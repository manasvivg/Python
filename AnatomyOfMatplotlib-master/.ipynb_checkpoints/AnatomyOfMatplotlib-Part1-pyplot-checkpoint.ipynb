      "# Matplotlib\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "Matplotlib is a library for producing publication-quality figures. mpl (for short) was designed from the bottom-up to serve dual-purposes. First, to allow for interactive, cross-platform control of figures and plots, and second, to make it very easy to produce static raster or vector graphics files without the need for any GUIs. Furthermore, mpl -- much like Python itself -- gives the developer complete control over the appearance of their plots, while still being very usable through a powerful defaults system.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Online Documentation\n",
      "The [matplotlib.org](http://matplotlib.org) project website is the primary online resource for the library's documentation. It contains [examples](http://matplotlib.org/examples/index.html), [FAQs](http://matplotlib.org/faq/index.html), [API documentation](http://matplotlib.org/api/index.html), and, most importantly, the [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Gallery\n",
      "Many users of matplotlib are often faced with the question, \"I want to make a plot that has X with Y in the same figure, but it needs to look like Z\". Good luck getting an answer from a web search with that query. This is why the [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) is so useful, because it showcases the variety of ways one can make plots. Browse through the gallery, click on any figure that has pieces of what you want to see the code that generated it. Soon enough, you will be like a chef, mixing and matching components to produce your masterpiece!\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, if you have a new and interesting plot that demonstrates a feature of matplotlib, feel free to submit a well-commented version of the example code for inclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Mailing Lists and StackOverflow\n",
      "When you are just simply stuck, and can not figure out how to get something to work, or just need some hints on how to get started, you will find much of the community at the matplotlib-users [mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=80706). This mailing list is an excellent resource of information with many friendly members who just love to help out newcomers. The number one rule to remember with this list is to be persistant. While many questions do get answered fairly quickly, some do fall through the cracks, or the one person who knows the answer isn't available. Therefore, try again with your questions rephrased, or with a plot showing your attempts so far. We love plots, so an image showing what is wrong often gets the quickest responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another community resource is [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/matplotlib), so if you need to build up karma points, submit your questions here, and help others out too!\n",
      "\n",
      "# Github repository\n",
      "## Location\n",
      "[Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib) is hosted by GitHub.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Bug Reports and feature requests\n",
      "So, you think you found a bug? Or maybe you think some feature is just too difficult to use? Or missing altogether? Submit your bug reports [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues) at matplotlib's issue tracker. We even have a process for submitting and discussing Matplotlib Enhancement Proposals ([MEPs](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/wiki)).\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is this \"backend\" thing I keep hearing about?\n",
      "Matplotlib has multiple backends. The backends allow mpl to be used on a variety of platforms with a variety of GUI toolkits (GTK, Qt, Wx, etc.), all of them written so that most of the time, you will not need to care which backend you are using. However, bugs do occur, and so two of the most important pieces of information you can provide in a bug report is which version of matplotlib, and which backend."

      "# Colorbars\n",
      "Colorbars are much like legends because they help to describe the data being displayed. While legends describe plots, i.e., plot(), scatter(), hist(), stem(), colorbars describe images. To be really specific and technical, they can be used for any \"ScalarMappable\", which will be discussed in the `Artists` section. Let us take a look at a very simple example of a colorbar for a simple 2D image."

      "Looks terrible, right? What is happening is that a colorbar in matplotlib is just a very squashed subplot with an image of the colormap and axis ticks and labels. When told to create a colorbar for an image, matplotlib will simply \"steal\" space from that image's subplot and create a new subplot. There are a couple ways to deal with this issue. First, if you preallocate space for the colorbar (by creating your own Axes object to add to the Figure), you can pass that preallocated Axes to the \"cax\" argument of [`plt.colorbar()`](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.colorbar), and it won't have to steal any space. The easier option is to pass a list of all the axes objects to `plt.colorbar(..., ax)`, and it will steal space equally from them."
